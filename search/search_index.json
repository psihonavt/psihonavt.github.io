Because I felt stuck. No purpose and no direction. Do I want to start another software engineering job? I don't know ... don't feel like it right now. But when I'm running out of money, I'll change my tune. What do I want? I don't know. What do I know? I know that I want to leave my comfort zone and explore. The growth comes from discomfort, right? I'm not gonna lie, leaving my job was scary. Deciding to take a break from full-time employment for \"self exploration\" was scary. Well, not so much scary but rather anxiety-inducing. The source of anxiety is money. I'm in a super privileged position of having substantial savings, but it feels \"uncomfortable\" to burn through them... but it's just me bitching. Any great adventure involves sacrifice. Shedding some $$ isn't even that much of a sacrifice. Anyway, the plan is to embark on a long roadtrip with an open heart and mind. With a readiness to embrace both good and bad things that happen along the way. I'll be taking notes along the way ... mainly to have something to share and reflect on. The roadtrip didn't start with me hitting the road \u2013 it started with me making a decision. A test run of making beef jerkies in the oven. Before: After: The jerky turned out to be fine. But the oven with its door ajar (to let the air with moisture escape) kept setting off the CO2 detectors. Annoying - the dehydration session was 7-8 hours. I would've used a French word Touch\u00e9 here. Because I thought, for years, that it's a fancy way of saying \"too bad\". No, touch\u00e9 in French means an acknowledgment during a discussion. So I borrowed a dehydration machine from Josh (who, by the way, is totally weaker than me). I want to make several batches to take with me on a trip. I also hacked together a spigot for my water jug: It's amazing how much more energy and motivation I have to work on [small] things without having to worry about my job. Day 2 # 01/13/2025 I want these journal entries to be available online. I use Obsidian for taking notes, and it has an official \"publish\" service for $8/mo. It looks really nice and convenient ... but expensive. I think I can mange to publish stuff through GitHub pages for $0. I already have a domain registered, and mkdocs + github actions + github pages combo looks like a simple and straightforward solution. I dropped off my Cube for oil change. Also, I asked Kenny to perform the thorough undercarriage inspection. Cube isn't a quiet - though it's AMAZING \u2013 something is always rattling or whistling, but it has been this way for as long as I've owned it \u2013 at least 50k miles worth of driving. But I figured some peace of mind before setting out for a long drive wouldn't hurt. Well, everything seems to be fine; they replaced rear brake pads and did some adjustments. Day 3 # Oh boy ... low gauge wires and high current connectors are expensive. Good thing I have an Amazon Prime trial; it ends tomorrow though. I need to decide on a day when I depart. Hopefully, I'll finish the power setup upgrades this week. Everything else can be done on the road. I received a call from my Medi-Cal Case Officer, my application might be approved soon. I don't know if I want to delay me leaving until I get approved... $670/mo is a lot of money to pay for my current insurance through COBRA. I think I had a very interesting instance of carbon monoxide poisoning yesterday. I was cooking borscht and baking a pie in parallel. In a tiny apartment with all doors and windows shut. I noticed an elevated heart rate and some palpitations (like, the heart was beating heavy). But then I left for my Monday pickleball ... and I was on fire. My precision and situational awareness were superb. Also, who would've guessed, my English was quite smooth too. And when I got back home, all my CO detectors were going off like crazy \u2013 it was kinda hard to breathe inside. Anyway, today I asked Claude AI if CO poisoning could cause the \"enhanced\" performance I observed. Well, it could. But not because occasional CO exposure is \"healthy\", but rather the poisoning triggered stress release of adrenaline and other hormones that boosted my performance. Some studies.","title":"January"},{"location":"nav/roadtrip1/01%20January/#day-1","text":"01/12/2025 Why did I leave Nimble? Because I felt stuck. No purpose and no direction.
