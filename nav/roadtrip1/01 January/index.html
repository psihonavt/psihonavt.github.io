<p>Why did I leave Nimble? Because I felt stuck. No purpose and no direction. Do I want to start another software engineering job? I don't know ... don't feel like it right now. But when I'm running out of money, I'll change my tune. What do I want? I don't know. What do I know? I know that I want to leave my comfort zone and explore. The growth comes from discomfort, right? I'm not gonna lie, leaving my job was scary. Deciding to take a break from full-time employment for "self exploration" was scary. Well, not so much scary but rather anxiety-inducing. The source of anxiety is money. I'm in a super privileged position of having substantial savings, but it feels "uncomfortable" to burn through them ...  but it's just me bitching. Any great adventure involves sacrifice. Shedding some <code>$$</code> isn't even that much of a sacrifice. </p>
<p>Anyway, the plan is to embark on a long roadtrip with an open heart and mind. With a readiness to embrace both good and bad things that happen along the way. I'll be taking notes along the way ... mainly to have something to share and reflect on.  The roadtrip didn't start with me hitting the road – it started with me making a decision. </p>
<p>A test run of making beef jerkies in the oven. Before:<br />
<img alt="Pasted image 20250112173243.png" src="../../../assets/obsidian_attachments/Pasted%20image%2020250112173243.png" /><br />
After: <br />
<img alt="Pasted image 20250113122532.png" src="../../../assets/obsidian_attachments/Pasted%20image%2020250113122532.png" /><br />
The jerky turned out to be fine. But the oven  with its door ajar (to let the air with moisture escape) kept setting off the CO2 detectors. Annoying - the dehydration session was 7-8 hours. I would've used a French word <code>Touché</code> here. Because I thought, for years, that it's a fancy way of saying "too bad". No, <code>touché</code> in French means an acknowledgment during a discussion.  </p>
<p>So I borrowed a dehydration machine from Josh (who, by the way, is totally weaker than me). I want to make several batches to take with me on a trip. </p>
<p>I also hacked together a spigot for my water jug:<br />
<img alt="Pasted image 20250113161454.png" src="../../../assets/obsidian_attachments/Pasted%20image%2020250113161454.png" /><br />
It's amazing how much more energy and motivation I have to work on [small] things without having to worry about my job.</p>

<p>I want these journal entries to be available online. I use Obsidian for taking notes, and it has an official "publish" service for $8/mo. It looks really nice and convenient ...  but expensive. I think I can mange to publish stuff through GitHub pages for $0. I already have a domain registered, and mkdocs + github actions + github pages combo looks like a simple and straightforward solution. </p>
<p>I dropped off my Cube for oil change. Also, I asked Kenny to perform the thorough undercarriage inspection. Cube isn't a quiet - though it's AMAZING – something is always rattling or whistling, but it has been this way for as long as I've owned it – at least 50k miles worth of driving. But I figured some peace of mind before setting out for a long drive wouldn't hurt. Well, everything seems to be fine; they replaced rear brake pads and did some adjustments.</p>

<p>Oh boy ... low gauge wires and high current connectors are expensive. Good thing I have an Amazon Prime trial; it ends tomorrow though. </p>
<p>I need to decide on a day when I depart. Hopefully, I'll finish the power setup upgrades this week. Everything else can be done on the road. </p>
<p>I received a call from my Medi-Cal Case Officer, my application might be approved soon. I don't know if I want to delay me leaving until I get approved ... $670/mo is a lot of money to pay for my current insurance through COBRA. </p>
<p>I think I had a very interesting instance of carbon monoxide poisoning yesterday. I was cooking borscht and baking a pie in parallel. In a tiny apartment with all doors and windows shut. I noticed an elevated heart rate and some palpitations (like, the heart was beating heavy). But then I left for my Monday pickleball ... and I was on fire. My precision and situational awareness were superb. Also, who would've guessed, my English was quite smooth too. And when I got back home, all my CO detectors were going off like crazy – it was kinda hard to breathe inside. Anyway, today I asked Claude AI if CO poisoning could cause the "enhanced" performance I observed. Well, it could. But not because occasional CO exposure is "healthy", but rather the poisoning triggered stress release of adrenaline and other hormones that boosted my performance. <a href="https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/physiology/articles/10.3389/fphys.2024.1490205/full">Some studies.</a></p>

<p>I tried making jerky using the Dehydro machine (~1.1 pounds of beef and ~0.3 pounds of ground bison):</p>
<p><img alt="Pasted image 20250115181419.png" src="../../../assets/obsidian_attachments/Pasted%20image%2020250115181419.png" /></p>
<p>It yielded:<br />

<p>The prep was simple, the machine just works. I think I'll dehydrate all the meat I have in the freezer. I ran the machine for around six hours. The bison meat needed more time – the jerky had too much fat on them; I don't think it would've lasted for long in room temperature.</p>

<p>I got a new charger for my battery, a 12v/30A smart charger. An expensive sucker, but I figured it'd be quite handy to have a faster charging time when I'm on the road. The charger came with no wires, and since the output current is relatively high, the user manual called for 6 AWG wires. I never crimped a wire that thick without a crimping tool, but it can't be harder than crimping thinner wires, which I've crimped many times, right? Wrong. Attempts to crimp 6 AWG battery terminals with pliers and a nut were a waste of time and money. And then Anderson Powerpole Connector terminals, huge and VERY sturdy. Josh made a good suggestion of heating up the terminal before trying to crimp it. After burning my fingertips a bit, I got this:</p>
<p><img alt="Pasted image 20250117184707.png" src="../../../assets/obsidian_attachments/Pasted%20image%2020250117184707.png" /></p>
<p>It looked "good enough" to me ... but it wasn't. </p>
<p>I also tried to use my small clamp tool, but without it being affixed to a tabletop and a longer lever, I failed miserably to even make a tiny dent in the terminal:</p>
<p><img alt="Pasted image 20250117185445.png" src="../../../assets/obsidian_attachments/Pasted%20image%2020250117185445.png" /></p>
<p>I wired everything together, connected the charger ... and it was a complete failure. The connections were <em>worryingly</em> warm to the touch – a sign that there is a poor connection (precious electrical energy escapes as heat!). Even though it was alarming, the main issue was in the charger not being able to read the correct voltage on a battery due to a voltage drop -&gt; it didn't supply a high enough current thinking that the charging process must be in the absorption phase.  </p>
<p>Long story short, I got a hydraulic crimping tool and a set of new terminals ($100 😭), stripped old terminals, and crimped new terminals using the right tool. Beautiful:</p>
<p><img alt="Pasted image 20250117192638.png" src="../../../assets/obsidian_attachments/Pasted%20image%2020250117192638.png" /><br />
At this point, I've spent more money on my custom power setup than a decent EcoFlow power station would cost. Learning is expensive. Using the right tools saves money and time. Experience is priceless. </p>
<p>I've decided on the date of departure – January 22nd.</p>

<p>Tomorrow is the day. I think I did fairly well playing a game of elimination while packing my stuff for the trip. At first, I was a bit at a loss on how to organize different items, but if you group things by categories everything starts making sense. A green cabinet - kitchen stuff; a water jug - a water jug; a big black box with a yellow lid - garage/tools stuff; smaller boxes - different foods divided into food categories; a large collapsible black box - clothes and related stuff; a wooden box - power setup stuff. Some stuff didn't make it into the picture, but everything should fit inside the Cube quite neatly. <br />

<p>Who would've guessed that they grow palm trees for sale in the Coachella valley. At first, I thought it was some fancy resort with a palm forest on site. But then those "forests" started popping up one after another. <br />

<p>A canyon with an uninspiring name "Box canyon" is my campsite for tonight. Quite a picturesque place, but sandy. I wish my Cube was AWD so I could drive some of the dirt roads. <br />

<p>Pumped a full tank of gas for $2.99/gallon; got sentimental.</p>
<p>It's my first time visiting a proper Arizona desert. Maybe it's not much different from Californian high desert, but it's the first time I saw such big cacti up close.<br />
<img alt="PXL_20250124_004948261.jpg" src="../../../assets/obsidian_attachments/PXL_20250124_004948261.jpg" /><br />

<p>It's also surprisingly easy to get lost in this desert (I haven't yet).<br />

<p>I woke up at 10am today and felt kinda guilty for being that lazy. But then, I didn't sleep well the night before and the morning was so cozy – not too cold not too warm and quiet. I guess my body needed the rest. Speaking of quietness –  small planes would fly above me every half an hour or so during daytime. I wonder why – the place was quite far from the Mexican border.</p>
<p>I drove a bunch today through Arizona and Tucson metro area in particular – everything is bustling with activity. The freeways are really good, everything looks very fresh and taken care of. I forgot that Arizona has only been a state since 1912. And the gas prices – $3/gallon or well below – makes me wonder about the tax structure on gas compared to California.</p>
<p>When I was getting some groceries in a store, I noticed the absence of tax. Apparently, food items intended for home consumption are exempt by law from the Arizona transaction privilege tax. I like that. </p>
<p>The sunset had unusual colors to it today. Reminded me of Utah. <br />

<p>I want to keep this trip as spontaneous as possible. But it's easier said than done – the moment I open Google maps to plan the route, I get flooded with attractions and points of interest. As a result, a lot of what you're going to see or visit is influenced by Google maps. </p>
<p>I saw a sign "Scenic highway 83; Patagonia" while driving to my intermediate destination in the morning. Yeah, the Arizona Patagonia. I took the detour and was rewarded with a view. The prominence of the mountains resembles what I've seen in the pictures of "real" Patagonia:<br />

<p>I made a stop at the Kartchner Caverns State Park. A really neat small park; relatively new - established in 2003. As the name states, the main attraction are two huge caverns discovered back in 1974. I was lucky to get the last spot on a cavern tour; the stuff is popular and gets sold out quickly. I quite enjoyed the tour – they keep the groups small, rangers were super funny and answered all the questions; the cavern was impressive. They don't allow to take pictures inside so I'll hold onto my memories for this one.</p>
<p>A fact from the Animal kingdom. The bats usually mate in late fall/winter. Then they hibernate for several months. Then female bats fly to a cavern (such as I visited in a state park), get pregnant, and birth their pups. The caveat is that there are no males; males have no business in a cave because the female bats hold on to male's sperm and let it fertilize eggs when needed only. TIL.</p>
<p>I had a history lesson at another museum (not subsidized by the government). Aliens are real, no shit:<br />

<p>I went with the flow of the road today – only looked up highway numbers on Google maps and that's it. And it was awesome. Smaller state highways are awesome. You notice smaller things, but the smaller things is what defines a state, a county, or a town, right?</p>
<p>I passed through the town of Clifton today, a historic boom town where copper mining saw its inception. The town is cute with nice old buildings, but you could see that the money has left it long ago. 5 miles from it is another mining town, Morenci, named after one of the world biggest copper mines (biggest in North America) - the thing is absolutely massive (not as big as Josh, though) - 80 square miles and growing. At the expense of the nearby mountains. The price of progress.<br />

Leaving the mine I dropped right into the Apache National Forest. Freeway 180 that runs through is gorgeous and completely empty. I've seen only a handful of other cars the entire day - loved it. At some point, I randomly glanced at my offline Gaia GPS maps and saw a short trail stemming off of a highway to some peak. After driving for a couple of hours I felt compelled to move for a bit, so I figured I could run up (haha) this trail. Well, the peak had a surprise for me, a fire lookout tower. I wish it were opened though.<br />

Some years ago, I listened to a podcast where they were telling the stories of volunteers who spend months at a time in those towers, observing the mountains for signs of wildfires. I wouldn't mind trying that out myself. </p>

<p>A shout out goes to the mediocre Internet coverage in rural Arizona and New Mexico; it feels good not to have service during overnight stays. Makes you think of how little Internet and Internet-based entertainment I need – the itch is there, though. </p>
<p>I spent yesterday's night near the town of Alpine in Apache NF, and what a picturesque area it is. Easily on par with Mammoth Lakes area by my standards. Sure, the mountains are smaller but high altitude plains as beautiful as the towering giants in Sierra mountains. Driving through such areas I always have a desire to live there. But than what'd you do there? But than than, I live in LA and I don't know what I'd do 🤷‍♂️<br />

<p>Yesterday was the day of the first campfire meal. Technically I cooked it after I had dinner and only saw the result in the morning. I left the wrapped food in the pit not bothering to take it inside the car – it was freezing at night anyway. And then, driving out of the woods in the morning, I saw a wolf crossing the road. I'm almost sure it was a wolf – it was too large for a coyote, and it had grey fur. I'm glad it didn't visit me for dinner at night. <br />

<p>Talking about places to live in, would I want to live in a Pie Town? Well, they uphold their name and serve a huge variety of pies. Had a stop there for pies and shower. The pie-shop lady said they only have 120 people living there. A very tranquil place with donation-based showers at a local, completely empty, RV park. I made a grand donation in the amount of two dollars and a note to carry more small cash.</p>
<p>I saw this point on a map labeled "Very Large Array" (VLA) – the name is kinda "plain". But by now, I've learned that Americans tend to label the most extraordinary things with the most ordinary names. This spot turned out to be on my way – the biggest telescope in the world. It consists of an array of 28 "small" radio telescopes:<br />
<img alt="PXL_20250127_222608458.jpg" src="../../../assets/obsidian_attachments/PXL_20250127_222608458.jpg" /> <br />
All telescopes are synchronized and can be arranged in different formations depending on the current experiment – there are 40 miles of railroads and 72 stations to which individual dishes can be moved. The scale of this instrument is huge. (Josh still ranks number one though).</p>
<p>Being able to cook inside of a car is such a luxury – makes my journey so convenient. Thanks to Corinne for landing me her green cabinet. It has taken on the very important duty of a kitchenette:<br />

<p>I hunkered down on a random ranch off of a freeway for the previous night. While I was looking around for something to dig up a hole for number 2 late at night, I had an unexpected encounter with a cow's carcass. It looks much less menacing in daylight: <br />
<img alt="PXL_20250128_144329794.jpg" src="../../../assets/obsidian_attachments/PXL_20250128_144329794.jpg" />But this ranch kept on giving. The next morning while taking a leak, I had a friendly meeting with a bull. I noticed the bull; the bull noticed me; the bull produced multiple angry "mooo"s and wrapped it up with some bucking; I GTFO promptly.</p>
<p>A few miles from the site where I slept is a Trinity missile site – a place where they detonated the first nuclear bomb. Unfortunately it's closed to the public except for several days in October. </p>
<p>At the White Sands National Park visitor center, a random guy struck up a conversation with me about how awesome Honda Elements are. He totaled his Element recently and was wondering if I'm selling mine. I wished him luck.</p>
<p>The White Sands NP is something different from all other places I've seen. It's like you're in a winter wonderland but it's sand. Enjoyed some barefoot hiking across several dunes – the sand felt pristine, for lack of a better word.<br />

<p>Driving state freeways with next to zero traffic is very chill. But it's a trap, when you get back on busy roads, you must almost force yourself to be attentive again. I almost got rear-ended today because of an unusual road pattern on a freeway. Made me remember that guy who totaled his Element recently. I don't want to be "that guy". </p>
<p>Probably just a coincidence of me picking my route, but freeways in New Mexico are unusually straight; and now I know that the number of trucks in LA isn't that big. </p>

<p>I like the gas station coffee more than Starbucks coffee. Particularly in New Mexico, each gas station offers a variety of beans and fresh creamers. You're in control of how much coffee and cream you want (and therefore its temperature). And all of this costs only about $1.50. I have very low standards for coffee.</p>

The main room of this cave is something beyond comprehension, miles and miles of passageways and trails through the kingdom of dark elves. What you can see on a self guided tour is only relatively small portion of the cave system - there are literally hundreds of miles of adjacent caves opened only to researchers. I was seriously impressed. </p>

<p>Spent a lot of time driving today – crossed into Texas and made it to Big Bend NP. Spent a lot of time driving and thinking. Our attention span is a very valuable resource. Everyone knows about how distracting are social media, news, and such. But that's only the top of an iceberg. I've been very diligent with what I consume on the Internet: a select few news sources, several informational/educational podcasts, a set of YouTube channels I follow, plus Audible books. Nothing binge-able, nothing that could suck me in. But the stuff I consume still requires my attention, a lot of it. It doesn't matter if the quality of content is high – you spend your limited attention consuming it. It took me some abstinence from the Internet to realize it. Without the Internet, without my usual distractions, I end up thinking more about things that matter to me. Without distractions there is a certain continuity to these thoughts – I maintain a thread of thinking throughout the days; it's not choppy. Without distractions it's as if I have more room to think. One would call it boredom, but boredom creates spaces necessary for new thoughts and patterns to form.</p>
<p>I entered Texas in the area on top of Permian basin oil field. As usual , I took smaller state highways ... and, boy, Texas drills and sucks up that sweet dark juice a lot. For hours I was driving through one of the most industrial landscapes I've ever seen – endless streams of work trucks, omnipresent oil rigs and storage tanks, and a lot of roadside debris. A freak sandstorm (maybe a regular occurrence there) buffeted my shoe-box shaped car relentlessly. A finishing streak was a sight of a dead bull by the roadside. </p>
<p>Did some cavern exploration earlier in the morning – kinda eerie but exhilarating. and surprisingly good full-body workout.<br />

<p>I'm on the fence about the Big Bend NP. On the one hand it has all attributes of a great national park, on the other I felt somewhat bored and dragging. Either I've been driving too much lately or I've overwhelemed by natural beauty.<br />

I spotted a line of ants crossing the trail today. Many of them carried small sticks, leaves, and other stuff that's not food. One guy was hauling a stick three times his size (while simultaneously navigating a rock; Josh has no excuse for not being able to do a "warm-up bolder" traverse).<br />

<p>Чому я пішов з Nimble? Бо відчував, що застряг. Ні мети, ні напрямку. Чи хочу я починати нову роботу програмістом? Не знаю... зараз якось не тягне. Але коли закінчаться гроші, заспіваю іншу пісню. Чого я хочу? Не знаю. Що я знаю? Знаю, що хочу вийти із зони комфорту і досліджувати світ. Ріст приходить через дискомфорт, правда ж? Не буду брехати, звільнятися було страшно. Вирішити взяти паузу в кар'єрі заради "пошуку себе" було страшно. Ну, не так страшно, як тривожно. Джерело тривоги – гроші. Я в супер привілейованому положенні, маючи суттєві заощадження, але якось "некомфортно" їх проїдати... але це я просто ниюсь. Будь-яка велика пригода вимагає жертв. Витратити трохи <code>$$</code> – це навіть не така вже й жертва.</p>
<p>В будь-якому разі, план такий – вирушити в довгу подорож з відкритим серцем та розумом. З готовністю прийняти і хороше, і погане, що трапиться по дорозі. Буду робити нотатки... в основному щоб було чим поділитися і над чим поміркувати. Подорож почалася не з того, що я сів за кермо – вона почалася з того, що я прийняв рішення.</p>
<p>Тестовий прогон приготування в'яленої яловичини в духовці. До:<br />

В'ялене м'ясо вийшло нормальним. Але духовка з прочиненими дверцятами (щоб випускати вологе повітря) постійно вмикала датчики CO2. Дратує – сушка тривала 7-8 годин. Тут би я використав французьке слово <code>Touché</code>. Бо я роками думав, що це такий вишуканий спосіб сказати "як шкода". Ні, <code>touché</code> французькою означає визнання чиєїсь правоти під час дискусії.</p>
<p>Тому я позичив сушарку у Джоша (який, до речі, точно слабший за мене). Хочу зробити декілька партій, щоб взяти з собою в подорож.</p>
<p>Ще я змайстрував краник для своєї бутлі з водою:<br />

Думаю, я зможу опублікувати все через GitHub pages за $0. У мене вже є зареєстрований домен, і комбінація mkdocs + github actions + github pages виглядає як просте і зрозуміле рішення.</p>
<p>Відвіз свій Cube на заміну масла. Також попросив Кенні зробити ретельний огляд днища. Cube не можна назвати тихим - хоча він НЕЙМОВІРНИЙ - щось постійно торохтить або свистить, але так було завжди, відколи він у мене - принаймні останні 80 тисяч кілометрів. Але я подумав, що трохи спокою перед довгою поїздкою не завадить. Що ж, виявилося все гаразд; вони замінили задні гальмівні колодки і зробили деякі регулювання.</p>

<p>Ох ... дроти низького калібру та конектори для великого струму – то недешеве задоволення. Добре, що в мене є пробний період Amazon Prime, хоча він закінчується завтра.</p>
<p>Треба визначитися з датою від'їзду. Сподіваюся, цього тижня закінчу з апгрейдом електросистеми. Все інше можна буде зробити вже в дорозі.</p>
<p>Телефонував мій офіцер з Medi-Cal, схоже, мою заявку скоро схвалять. Не знаю, чи варто відкладати від'їзд до отримання схвалення... $670 на місяць за моє теперішнє страхування через COBRA – це чимала сума.</p>
<p>Здається, вчора в мене був цікавий досвід отруєння чадним газом. Паралельно варив борщ і пік пиріг. У крихітній квартирі з зачиненими дверима й вікнами. Помітив підвищений пульс і серцебиття (таке важке). Але потім пішов на свій звичний понеділковий пікльбол... і там я просто запалював. Точність і ситуаційна обізнаність були суперові. І, хто б міг подумати, англійська теж йшла дуже гладко. А коли повернувся додому, всі датчики чадного газу верещали як навіжені – було важкувато дихати всередині. В будь-якому разі, сьогодні я запитав ШІ Claude, чи може отруєння CO викликати таке "покращення" продуктивності, яке я спостерігав. Виявляється, може. Але не тому, що випадкове отруєння CO "корисне", а тому що отруєння спровокувало стресовий викид адреналіну та інших гормонів, які підвищили мою продуктивність. <a href="https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/physiology/articles/10.3389/fphys.2024.1490205/full">Деякі дослідження.</a></p>

<p>Підготовка була простою, машина просто працює як треба. Думаю, я засушу все м'ясо, що в мене є в морозилці. Машина працювала приблизно шість годин. Бізоняче м'ясо потребувало більше часу – на в'яленому м'ясі було забагато жиру; не думаю, що воно довго протрималося б при кімнатній температурі.</p>

<p>Купив новий зарядний пристрій для акумулятора, розумну зарядку на 12в/30А. Недешева зараза, але я подумав, що на дорозі швидша зарядка буде дуже доречною. Зарядка прийшла без дротів, а оскільки вихідний струм досить високий, в інструкції рекомендували дроти 6 AWG. Я ніколи не обтискав такі товсті дроти без спеціального інструменту, але ж це не може бути складніше, ніж обтискати тонші дроти, які я робив багато разів, правда? Неправда. Спроби обтиснути клеми акумулятора 6 AWG плоскогубцями та гайковим ключем виявились марною тратою часу й грошей. А ще ці роз'єми Anderson Powerpole – величезні й ДУЖЕ міцні. Джош порадив нагріти клему перед обтисканням. Після того, як трохи обпік пальці, отримав ось це:</p>
<p><img alt="Pasted image 20250117184707.png" src="../../../assets/obsidian_attachments/Pasted%20image%2020250117184707.png" /></p>
<p>Мені здавалося, що вийшло "нормально"... але ні.</p>
<p>Я також спробував використати свій маленький затискач, але без надійної фіксації до столу та довшого важеля навіть найменшої вм'ятини на клемі не вдалося зробити:</p>
<p><img alt="Pasted image 20250117185445.png" src="../../../assets/obsidian_attachments/Pasted%20image%2020250117185445.png" /></p>
<p>З'єднав усе докупи, підключив зарядку... і повний провал. З'єднання <em>тривожно</em> нагрівались – ознака поганого контакту (дорогоцінна електрична енергія перетворюється на тепло!). Хоча це й насторожувало, головна проблема була в тому, що зарядка не могла правильно визначити напругу на акумуляторі через падіння напруги -&gt; вона не видавала достатній струм, думаючи, що процес заряджання вже має бути на стадії поглинання.</p>
<p>Коротше кажучи, я купив гідравлічний обтискач і набір нових клем (100 баксів 😭), зняв старі клеми й обтиснув нові правильним інструментом. Краса:</p>

<p>На цей момент я вже витратив на свою саморобну систему живлення більше грошей, ніж коштує пристойна станція EcoFlow. Навчання – річ недешева. Використання правильних інструментів економить гроші та час. Досвід – безцінний.</p>

<p>Завтра цей день настане. Думаю, я непогано впорався з грою на вибування, поки пакував речі для подорожі. Спочатку я трохи розгубився, як організувати різні предмети, але коли групуєш речі за категоріями, все стає на свої місця. Зелена шафа - кухонне приладдя; бутель для води - ну, власне, бутель для води; велика чорна коробка з жовтою кришкою - гаражне/інструменти; менші коробки - різна їжа, розсортована за категоріями; велика розкладна чорна коробка - одяг та все, що з ним пов'язане; дерев'яна коробка - всі речі для електрики. Дещо не потрапило на фото, але все має акуратно поміститися в Куб.<br />

<p>Хто б міг подумати, що в долині Коачелла вирощують пальми на продаж. Спочатку я думав, що це якийсь модний курорт з пальмовим гаєм. Але потім ці "гаї" почали з'являтися один за одним.<br />

<p>Каньйон з не дуже надихаючою назвою "Box canyon" – моє місце ночівлі на сьогодні. Доволі мальовниче місце, але піщане. Шкода, що мій Cube не повнопривідний – міг би проїхатися деякими ґрунтовками.<br />

<p>Вперше відвідую справжню аризонську пустелю. Можливо, вона не дуже відрізняється від каліфорнійської високогірної пустелі, але це перший раз, коли я побачив такі величезні кактуси зблизька.<br />

<p>Сьогодні прокинувся о 10-й ранку і відчув легке почуття провини за таку лінь. Але потім згадав, що вночі погано спав, а ранок був такий затишний – ні холодно, ні жарко, і тихо. Мабуть, моєму тілу просто потрібен був відпочинок. До речі, про тишу – невеликі літаки пролітали наді мною приблизно кожні півгодини протягом дня. Цікаво чому – місце ж досить далеко від мексиканського кордону.</p>
<p>Сьогодні чимало проїхав через Арізону, особливо через околиці Тусона – все кипить життям. Автомагістралі дійсно хороші, все виглядає дуже свіжим і доглянутим. Я й забув, що Арізона стала штатом лише в 1912 році. А ціни на бензин – $3 за галон або навіть нижче – змушують замислитись про структуру податків на пальне порівняно з Каліфорнією.</p>
<p>Коли купував продукти в магазині, помітив відсутність податку. Виявляється, продукти харчування, призначені для домашнього споживання, за законом звільнені від податку на привілей торгівлі в Арізоні. Мені це подобається.</p>
<p>Сьогодні захід сонця мав незвичайні кольори. Нагадав мені Юту.<br />

<p>Хочу зберегти цю подорож якомога спонтаннішою. Але легше сказати, ніж зробити – варто лише відкрити Google Maps для планування маршруту, як мене накриває хвилею визначних місць та цікавих локацій. В результаті, багато з того, що ви побачите чи відвідаєте, продиктовано Google Maps.</p>
<p>Дорогою до проміжного пункту призначення вранці побачив знак "Мальовнича траса 83; Патагонія". Так-так, Аризонська Патагонія. Я звернув з маршруту і був винагороджений краєвидом. Велич цих гір нагадує те, що я бачив на фотографіях "справжньої" Патагонії:<br />

<p>Зробив зупинку в Державному парку печер Картчнера. Дійсно класний невеликий парк; відносно новий - заснований у 2003 році. Як можна здогадатися з назви, головна принада - дві величезні печери, відкриті ще в 1974 році. Мені пощастило урвати останнє місце на екскурсію печерами; ці тури дуже популярні і швидко розпродаються. Екскурсія мені дуже сподобалась – групи тримають маленькими, рейнджери були суперкумедними і відповідали на всі питання; печера вражала. Фотографувати всередині не дозволяють, тож це залишиться лише в моїх спогадах.</p>
<p>Факт з тваринного світу. Кажани зазвичай паруються пізньої осені/взимку. Потім вони впадають у сплячку на кілька місяців. Після цього самки кажанів летять до печери (такої, як я відвідав у державному парку), вагітніють і народжують малят. Цікавий нюанс - самців там немає; їм нічого робити в печері, бо самки зберігають сперму самців і дають їй запліднити яйцеклітини лише коли потрібно. Отаке я сьогодні дізнався.</p>
<p>В іншому музеї (не субсидованому державою) отримав урок історії. Прибульці існують, без жартів:<br />

<p>Сьогодні я просто плив за течією дороги – лише дивився номери шосе на Google Maps, і все. І це було чудово. Маленькі штатні шосе – це щось особливе. Помічаєш дрібніші деталі, але ж саме дрібниці визначають характер штату, округу чи містечка, хіба ні?</p>
<p>Сьогодні проїжджав через містечко Кліфтон, історичне місто-бум, де зародився мідний видобуток. Містечко симпатичне, зі старовинними будівлями, але одразу видно, що гроші покинули його давно. За 8 кілометрів від нього – інше шахтарське місто, Моренсі, назване на честь однієї з найбільших мідних копалень у світі (найбільшої в Північній Америці) – це щось неймовірно величезне (хоча й не таке велике, як Джош) – 207 квадратних кілометрів, і воно росте. Ціною навколишніх гір. Ціна прогресу.<br />

Виїхавши з копальні, я одразу потрапив до Національного лісу Апачі. Шосе 180, що проходить крізь нього, просто розкішне і абсолютно порожнє. За весь день я бачив лише кілька машин – кайф. В якийсь момент я випадково глянув на свої офлайн-карти Gaia GPS і помітив коротку стежку, що відгалужується від шосе до якоїсь вершини. Після кількох годин за кермом мені закортіло порухатись, тож я вирішив, що можу збігати (ха-ха) цією стежкою. Що ж, на вершині на мене чекав сюрприз – пожежна спостережна вежа. Шкода тільки, що вона була зачинена.<br />
<img alt="PXL_20250126_221926598.jpg" src="../../../assets/obsidian_attachments/PXL_20250126_221926598.jpg" /><br />
Кілька років тому я слухав подкаст, де розповідали історії волонтерів, які проводять місяці в таких вежах, спостерігаючи за горами у пошуках ознак лісових пожеж. Я б не проти спробувати це й сам.</p>

<p>Окреме "дякую" посереднього якості інтернету в сільській місцевості Аризони та Нью-Мексико; як же добре коли немає зв'язку під час нічних зупинок. Змушує замислитись, як мало мені насправді потрібно інтернету та розваг, які він пропонує – хоча свербіж все одно є.</p>
<p>Вчорашню ніч я провів біля містечка Алпайн в національному лісі Апачі, і яка ж це мальовнича місцевість. На мій погляд, не поступається району Мамонтових Озер. Звісно, гори тут нижчі, але високогірні рівнини такі ж прекрасні, як і величні гіганти в горах Сьєрра. Коли їду через такі місця, завжди виникає бажання тут жити. Але чим би ти тут займався? Хоча з іншого боку, я живу в ЛА і теж не знаю, чим я там займаюсь 🤷‍♂️<br />

<p>Вчора була перша страва, приготована на вогнищі. Технічно я приготував її після вечері і побачив результат лише вранці. Я залишив загорнуту їжу в ямі, не переймаючись тим, щоб занести її в машину – вночі все одно був мороз. А потім, виїжджаючи з лісу вранці, я побачив вовка, що перетинав дорогу. Я майже впевнений, що це був вовк – занадто великий для койота, і хутро сіре. Я радий, що він не завітав до мене на вечерю вночі.<br />

<p>Говорячи про місця для життя, чи хотів би я жити в Пай Тауні (Місто Пирогів)? Ну, вони виправдовують свою назву і подають величезний вибір пирогів. Зупинився там заради пирогів та душу. Жінка в пиріжковій сказала, що там живе лише 120 людей. Дуже спокійне місце з душовими за пожертви в місцевому, абсолютно порожньому, кемпінгу для трейлерів. Я зробив щедру пожертву в розмірі двох доларів і нотатку носити більше дрібних готівкою.</p>
<p>Я побачив на карті точку з назвою "Very Large Array" (VLA) – назва якась "проста". Але я вже зрозумів, що американці мають звичку називати найнезвичайніші речі найбуденнішими іменами. Це місце виявилося на моєму шляху – найбільший телескоп у світі. Він складається з масиву 28 "маленьких" радіотелескопів:<br />
<img alt="PXL_20250127_222608458.jpg" src="../../../assets/obsidian_attachments/PXL_20250127_222608458.jpg" /><br />
Всі телескопи синхронізовані і можуть бути розташовані в різних формаціях залежно від поточного експерименту – тут 64 кілометри залізничних колій та 72 станції, до яких можна перемістити окремі антени. Масштаб цього інструменту величезний. (Хоча Джош все одно номер один).</p>
<p>Можливість готувати всередині машини – це такий комфорт, робить мою подорож набагато зручнішою. Дякую Корінн за її зелену шафку. Вона взяла на себе дуже важливу роль кухоньки:<br />

<p>Минулої ночі я притулився на якомусь ранчо біля шосе. Поки я вночі шукав чимось викопати ямку для нужди, несподівано натрапив на коров'ячий труп. При денному світлі воно виглядало вже не так моторошно:<br />
<img alt="PXL_20250128_144329794.jpg" src="../../../assets/obsidian_attachments/PXL_20250128_144329794.jpg" />Але це ранчо продовжувало дивувати. Наступного ранку, коли я відлив, відбулася дружня зустріч з биком. Я помітив бика; бик помітив мене; бик видав кілька злих "мууу" і почав буцатися; я НАХРІН ЗВІДТИ ЗМИВСЯ.</p>
<p>За кілька кілометрів від місця, де я спав, знаходиться полігон ракети Трініті – місце, де підірвали першу ядерну бомбу. На жаль, воно закрите для відвідувачів, окрім кількох днів у жовтні.</p>
<p>У візит-центрі національного парку Вайт-Сендс якийсь random чувак зав'язав зі мною розмову про те, які круті Honda Element. Він нещодавно розбив свій Element вщент і питав, чи не продаю я свій. Побажав йому удачі.</p>
<p>Вайт-Сендс – це щось зовсім інакше від усіх місць, які я бачив. Наче ти в зимовій казці, але це пісок. Насолодився босоногою прогулянкою через кілька дюн – пісок відчувався бездоганним, якщо можна так сказати.<br />

<p>Їхати порожніми штатними шосе – це кайф. Але це пастка, бо коли повертаєшся на завантажені дороги, доводиться майже змушувати себе бути уважним. Сьогодні мало не в'їхали в мене ззаду через незвичний дорожній патерн на шосе. Нагадало мені того чувака, який нещодавно розбив свій Element. Не хочу бути "тим чуваком".</p>
<p>Мабуть, це просто збіг, що я так проклав маршрут, але шосе в Нью-Мексико незвично прямі; і тепер я знаю, що кількість вантажівок в ЛА не така вже й велика.</p>

<p>Вовк, якого я бачив вчора, дійсно був вовком – мексиканським сірим вовком. Вони зазвичай сором'язливі і не чіпають людей. На відміну від територіальних биків.</p>

<p>Мені більше подобається кава на заправках, ніж у Старбаксі. Особливо в Нью-Мексико, де на кожній заправці пропонують різні сорти кави та свіжі вершки. Ти сам контролюєш скільки кави та вершків хочеш (і відповідно її температуру). І все це коштує лише близько $1.50. В мене дуже низькі стандарти щодо кави.</p>

Головний зал цієї печери – це щось за межами розуміння, кілометри й кілометри проходів та стежок через королівство темних ельфів. Те, що можна побачити під час самостійної екскурсії – це лише відносно невелика частина печерної системи – там буквально сотні кілометрів прилеглих печер, відкритих тільки для дослідників. Я був по-справжньому вражений.</p>
<p>Я спалив три запобіжники в машині, намагаючись змусити працювати зарядний пристрій. Добре, що я можу налаштувати максимальний вихідний струм у зарядці. Вихід на 11 ампер тримає мій 15-амперний запобіжник задоволеним.</p>

<p>Сьогодні багато часу провів за кермом – перетнув кордон Техасу і дістався до національного парку Біг-Бенд. Багато їхав і думав. Наша здатність концентрувати увагу – дуже цінний ресурс. Всі знають, наскільки відволікають соцмережі, новини і подібне. Але це лише верхівка айсберга. Я був дуже вибагливим щодо того, що споживаю в інтернеті: декілька відібраних новинних джерел, кілька інформаційних/освітніх подкастів, набір YouTube-каналів, які я відстежую, плюс книги на Audible. Нічого такого, на чому можна "підсісти", нічого, що могло б затягнути. Але навіть те, що я споживаю, все одно вимагає моєї уваги, причому чимало. Неважливо, наскільки високоякісний контент – ти витрачаєш на його споживання свою обмежену увагу. Я зрозумів це лише після певного утримання від інтернету. Без інтернету, без моїх звичних відволікань, я більше думаю про речі, які дійсно важливі для мене. Без відволікань з'являється певна безперервність цих думок – я підтримую нитку роздумів протягом днів; вона не переривається. Без відволікань ніби з'являється більше простору для роздумів. Хтось назвав би це нудьгою, але нудьга створює необхідний простір для формування нових думок і патернів.</p>
<p>Я в'їхав до Техасу в районі нафтового родовища Перміанського басейну. Як завжди, я обрав менші місцеві шосе... і, боже ж мій, як же Техас качає той солодкий темний сік. Годинами я їхав через один з найбільш індустріальних пейзажів, які коли-небудь бачив – нескінченні потоки робочих вантажівок, всюдисущі нафтові вишки та резервуари, і купа сміття вздовж доріг. Раптова піщана буря (можливо, звичне явище в тих краях) невпинно шарпала мою машину-коробку. Фінальним штрихом став вид мертвого бика на узбіччі.</p>
<p>Зранку досліджував печери – трохи моторошно, але захопливо. І, на диво, виявилось непоганим тренуванням для всього тіла.<br />

<p>Маю змішані почуття щодо національного парку Біг-Бенд. З одного боку, він має всі риси чудового національного парку, з іншого – мені було якось нудно і в'яло. Можливо, я останнім часом забагато кермую, або вже перенаситився природною красою.<br />

Сьогодні помітив колону мурах, що перетинала стежку. Багато хто з них ніс маленькі палички, листя та інше добро, яке не є їжею. Один товариш тягнув паличку втричі більшу за себе (і водночас спритно маневрував через камінь; у Джоша тепер немає виправдань, чому він не може пролізти "розминочний булдер").<br />
