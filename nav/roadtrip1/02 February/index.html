<p>I think Big Bend NP is one of those parks you don't fall for immediately. Like Death Valley or Joshua Tree. After exploring it a bit more, I started to see its appeal. Multiple ecosystems are encompassed in this huge park. Some parts give Death Valley vibes, others ‚Äì Grand Canyon and Zion. Not sure I want to go there again, though.</p>
<p>Mexico on the left, the US on the right:

<p>A V-easy boulder problem:

<p>I brought a slow cooker with me on this trip. It only draws 180W at peak consumption ‚Äì battery-friendly. Started the borscht before going to bed yesterday, and had it for breakfast and dinner today. And still have some left for tomorrow's breakfast:

<p>Leaving borscht in your car for 24 hours will give you diarrhea ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇ (no pictures).</p>
<p>My impressions about Texas so far: </p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>very little public lands (for historical reasons)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>it's hot in February</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>you want to get places ‚Äì you drive a lot</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>gas prices üòç</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>trucks, trucks everywhere</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>people seem to be friendlier from the get-go</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>On this trip I've been seeing a lot of Jeeps with rubber ducks lined up behind a windshield. At first, I though that it's the same jeep following me on my journey (which would've been cool), but then I spotted several duck-infested jeeps at the same time. The tradition is called "Jeep ducking" where the Jeep owners leave the rubber beasts on other Jeeps as a gesture of kindness.</p>
<p>When I was getting gas today, saw an option to get "ethanol-free" unleaded fuel. Made me wonder what's that. Apparently this non-ethanol fuel is more suitable for smaller engines, like ones in boats and lawnmowers ‚Äì where it can sit for extended periods of time and you don't want ethanol to attract moisture and cause issues.  Since the gas station was in a coastal city of Corpus Christi ‚Äì everything checks out. </p>

<p>A drive-through beach in Texas (Gulf of Mexi... America is on the left): <img alt="PXL_20250203_180206938.jpg" src="../../../assets/obsidian_attachments/PXL_20250203_180206938.jpg" /></p>
<p>I had breakfast in a diner, they had Fox News on a big screen TV ‚Äì I wish I continued my news abstinence. </p>
<p>Austin is definitely not a typical American city. I've only been to suburbs, but I felt like I was somewhere in the outskirts of Kyiv. </p>
<p>On a drive to Austin, I was listening to different podcasts focusing on current political events. Trump did promise to dismantle the deep state, and it seems like he and his team had a clear plan on how to achieve that. The takeover of the Treasury by Musk is only one of the steps. Reaction from Democrats has been spineless so far. Congress as a legislative branch also isn't concerned with the government messing with their field of influence. Everything seems like an erosion of democratic institutions in this country. One may argue that it's been happening for a while now, but not as quick and forceful as in the last several weeks. What a time to be alive. </p>
<p>A cute courthouse in the "capital" of BBQ in Texas (I have yet to try Texan BBQ):

<p>Austin in February is hot. A lot of residential construction is going on. The number of barbershops is surprising. </p>
<p>I found a campground in South Austin ‚Äì a small farmette within the city limits. It has showers, restrooms, chickens, goats, the Internet, and some interesting characters living on the property.

<p>The Cathedral of Trash somewhere in the neighborhood: 
<img alt="PXL_20250204_191810714.jpg" src="../../../assets/obsidian_attachments/PXL_20250204_191810714.jpg" /></p>
<p>I welcome a break from driving, for I definitely got tired of being on the road all the time. It's been almost two weeks since I left, and a discomfort from not having a "home base" has started creeping in. I guess it was expected.  </p>
<p>Another, quite obvious observation ‚Äì living out of a car/campgrounds is pretty comfortable, especially when the setup is right. But everything takes more time ‚Äì cooking, cleaning, moving between places, etc. And I don't have time for things I expected I would have more time for. I need to try staying in the same place for several days. </p>
<p>Walmart has been my friend on this trip. I like the prices and the selection. Also, I can buy a lug wrench and peanut butter at the same store ‚Äì convenient. What's not convenient is Walmart's policy on plastic bags, or rather the way cashiers distribute the items into the bags combined with how those bags are being placed for a buyer to pick them up. I bought five items there, including a steak for dinner. The bag with the steak never left Walmart üò©</p>
<p>My hippie campground has outdoor showers. For some reason, I really enjoy them. Or maybe I enjoy the mere fact of having a shower on demand?</p>

<p>Some of the streets in Austin could use more pedestrian crossings. My sampling data is very small, but the need to walk a quarter of a mile to cross a street in a residential neighborhood is annoying. </p>
<p>A contestant for the role of the best restroom:
<img alt="PXL_20250205_142549686.jpg" src="../../../assets/obsidian_attachments/PXL_20250205_142549686.jpg" /></p>
<p>I've been working on a hook for mkdocs that automatically adds Ukrainian translations for every journal entry. It's pretty impressive how advanced those models are. I can ask it for a "ready to go" solution to a problem and then iterate on the suggestions with the model. Like having a dialogue. It helps a lot that I'm very familiar with the domain ‚Äì the familiarity was earned with a lot of blood and sweat ‚Äì the timesaving is real. I used the LLM while building my power station ‚Äì a lot of basic questions about electricity and grid. While I ‚Äì a very proud graduate with an engineering degree, by the way ‚Äì might still be lacking fundamental knowledge, I was able to grasp all concepts needed to assemble the power station that covers my needs. Which is very cool. But at the same time, having superficial knowledge leads to false confidence and oopsie daisy. </p>
<p>The campground I'm staying at for the third and last night is called "Camp EZ". I called it a hippie campground, but, honestly, it's a pretty unique place. The founder, Jim, converted this farmland into a small community. There are up to ten-ish people who live permanently on the land. Everyone has their unique small house (usually built out of a repurposed trailer). A chicken coop. Several goats and donkeys. Donkeys are territorial and they keep coyotes away. I spotted at least three cats. One Greek and one Bulgarian. Small herds of deer would loiter around with zero cares given about people. I have mentioned outdoor showers. And one of the restrooms is plain gorgeous. I really enjoy having the "nature" one step away from where you live. Even if it's a car üôÇ</p>
<p>Perhaps, the only outcome of this trip will be my rating of the best restrooms I saw on this trip. </p></p>
